This is my personal blog on data, graphs, economics, and maybe space. I'm currently a student at Georgia Tech getting a Masters in Analytics. I studied economics at DePauw University and wrote a thesis on [colonizing Mars](https://scholarship.depauw.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1028&context=studentresearch) if that's your kind of thing. Currently working as an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The thoughts and opinions presented here are mine and nobody else's.
