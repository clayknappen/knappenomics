## The TLDR
Trying to make my way home from a vaction, I spent most of my day at three different airports yesterday. While that experience was not ideal, it did give me time to pick up and read [Personal Kanban: Mapping Work | Navigating Life](http://personalkanban.com/pk/book/) by Jim Benson and Tonianne DeMaria Barry. It's a relatively short read, weighing in at 173 pages, and a pretty easy read as well. If you're looking for something that can make your work more effective and give your work more meaning, then Personal Kanban is a perspective worth trying. It's simple, flexible, and introspective. There are just two rules: visualize your work, and limit work in progress. The rest is just recommendations for how to accomplish those two things. Reading this convinced me to give Personal Kanban a shot for a month to see how well it works in practice for me.  

## The Longer Version
If you work anywhere that's even remotely tangential to software development, you've probably heard the term *Agile*. I don't claim to know very much about Agile development, but it seems to come in many flavors (Scrum, Lean, Kanban, and etc). My work right now is primarily on the customer side of things, but I think it's worthwhile to learn a little about the development side so that we can have more of a shared language for talking about our goals, and so I can better understand what's going on with our projects. Having said that, it's been a long time since the software development class I took in college, and I wanted to find something with techniques that I could immediately put into practice for myself. Personal Kanban seemed to fit the ticket perfectly. Drawing from Kanban practices for projects, *Personal* Kanban focuses on how to improve the quality of life of a knowledge worker. 

The first thing I needed to learn was that there's a big difference between working *efficiently* and working *effectively*. Efficiency is about quantity and is characterized by to-do lists, while effectively is about quality and is characterized by flow. Do you ever feel like your life is being controlled by to-do lists? Me too. I come to work every day, open my email, add everything that got assigned to me last night to an existing list of things that I didn't finish yesterday, and try to work my way through the list (adding new assignments as they come in). There are several problems with this approach to work. 

1. Work is *pushed* rather than *pulled* - as soon as something is ready it gets pushed onto your plate, regardless of whether or not **you're** ready for it. This ends up meaning you work at capacity 24/7 and it robs you of any agency in determining what you work on. 
2. Accomplishments are ignored - the only measure of accomplishment that you get with a to-do list is how long the list is, and really you only feel any success if you successfully complete everything on your list. That in particular was killing my morale at work since most of the time work comes in fast enough that the list is never empty. 
3. Blind to patterns - if you do something enough you'll begin to see patterns. This is great, since it gives you opportunities to see where things go wrong, figure out how to improve processes, and learn about what you like and don't like. To-do lists ignore all of that. You just add to and cross off from the list. There's no reflection or learning. 

To-do lists are optimized for efficiency: completing as many tasks as possible. Personal Kanban is optimized for effectiveness: completing tasks in the best way possible. It has only two rules. 

1. Visualize your work
2. Limit Work in Progress (WIP)

In its simplest form, Personal Kanban can just be a whiteboard with three columns: **Ready**, **Doing**, and **Done**. When things are assigned to you, that means they're ready. You jot down the task on a sticky note and add it to the **Ready** column. When you're ready, you then physically *pull* the task into your **Doing** column. Then once you complete that task you then push it to the **Done** column. To limit your WIP you add a number to your **Doing** column so that it says something like **Doing (2)**. Then whenever you're tempted to move something from **Ready** to **Doing** that number will be there to tell you if you're doing too much. Your WIP limit can and should change! I plan to start with 2 and see how well that works for me, but maybe you would feel more comfortable starting with a different number. The goal is to be honest about how much you can handle at a time. If you try to do more than you can handle, you'll just end up back where you started (frustrated and not performing effectively). It's better to do a few things well than to not do a lot of things poorly. 

This is the form of Personal Kanban I plan to start with, but there are a couple of additional features you could add to *your* personal Kanban. The **Today** column can help you visualize how effective you are at completing your daily goals which can be really beneficial in helping you figure out your WIP number or in managing your own daily workload. If you get interrupted a lot by things at work that force you to leave some things half done, consider adding a **Pen** column. Then then next time you meet with your supervisor, you can point to that column as evidence of all the things that you have to give up whenever she interrupts you (bonus points if you call this the opportunity cost). If your work invovles a lot of back and forth with coworkers, a **Review** column can again visualize exactly what happens here. That document that's been sitting on someone's desk for a week? Now everyone can see it on your board. You can even *see* how much time gets wasted in back and forth reviews by the number of times you move your sticky note from one column to the other.  

Why is this better? Mostly because it respects you as a worker instead of as a mindless cog in the assembly line. It lets you pull work into your workspace as you're ready for it instead of when it's ready for you. You have a constant visualized measure of success. All you have to do is look at your **Done** comlumn to see exactly what you've accomplished. The act of moving things across the board reinforces patterns so you'll pick up on them, and it gives you easy ways to visualize things you've suspected but never really *known*.

Basically, I'm sold, and I'm going to spend the next month working on my own personal Kanban.
