<h1>Sankey Diagrams</h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankey_diagram">Sankey Diagrams</a> are a popular way of showing flows. Lately they’ve become pretty popular for showing budgets since they allow you to show the hierarchical relationships and proportions within groups pretty intuitively. Below, I just wanted to provide a really quick example of one of these using data from the <a href="www.bls.gov/cex">Consumer Expenditure Surveys</a>. Speifically, the data used come from the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cex/2017/combined/gener.pdf">2017 Generational table</a> to show how the average Millennial spends their money.</p>
<p>There are a couple of caveats:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Alcohol was combined with food to make a higher-level food and drinks category</li>
<li>Reading was moved into the entertainment category</li>
<li>Several smaller categories were regrouped into a larger miscellaneous category</li>
</ol>
<p>Other than that the data match exactly what’s in the official table. Enjoy!</p>
